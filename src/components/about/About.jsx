      <p>
        I am a dedicated and innovative professional transitioning into the tech
        industry . Having completed a Full Stack Developer Bootcamp at GOIT, I
        possess hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React through two
        group projects and a few personal. I excel in dynamic environments where
        I can leverage my creativity and fast-learning abilities to develop and
        deploy user-centric applications. My experience with Scrum and Agile
        methodologies further enhances my ability to deliver projects on time
        and within scope.
